#  Project: AnkiSanseido
#
#     "A plugin for MONOLINGUAL Japanese definition grabbing"
#
#  PURPOSE:
#  Purpose of this project is to interact with Anki (ankisrs.net) as a
#  plugin and load a definition from sanseido into a card. This will
#  avoid the user doing this manually for many cards.
#
#  Initial restrictions:
#    SANSEIDO RESTRICTIONS:
#      The user must have their own account with Sanseido.
#      The user user SHOULD login and *LOGOUT* each time they interact
#        with Sanseido. If a *LOGOUT* is not performed then the user will
#        likely be unable to access Sanseido for about 3 hours.
#    Coding restrictions:
#      To get the project running only djr1.dual-d.net will be used.
#      If this project gathers a following then other sanseido
#      dictionaries may be used.
